Problem Statement
The goal is to design and implement an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize demographic and socioeconomic data from the India Census 2011. The dashboard should present insights into population distribution, literacy rates, growth rates, sex ratio, workforce participation, and age group segmentation across states and districts.

 Steps to be Followed While Preparing the Dashboard
 
Step 1: Data Collection and Import
•	Import census data into Power BI Desktop. https://www.census2011.co.in/
•	Ensure the dataset includes details such as population, literacy rates, sex ratio, workforce participation, age groups, etc.

Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation
•	Remove inconsistent and duplicate records.
•	Fill in or handle null values appropriately.
•	Standardize column headers for clarity and consistency.

Step 3: Data Modeling
•	Create relationships between datasets, such as:
o	State ↔ District
o	Population ↔ Literacy Rates
o	Workforce ↔ Age Groups
•	Create calculated columns and DAX measures, such as
o	Total Population
o	Average Literacy Rate
o	Gender Ratio

Step 4: Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
•	Total Population by State/District
•	Male vs Female Population Ratios
•	Average Literacy Rate by State
•	Growth Rate Comparison
•	Workforce Segmentation (Agricultural, Cultivators, Household Workers, etc.)

Step 5: Dashboard Visualization
•	Use suitable visuals:
   o	Bar Charts: Population by State, Literacy Rates
   o	Line Graphs: Growth Rate Trends
   o	Pie Charts: Workforce Distribution by Gender
   o	Maps: State and District-Level Population Heatmap
•	Add slicers for filtering by State, District, Age Group, Gender, etc.

Step 6: Interactive Features
•	Enable drill-down and drill-through options.
•	Apply cross-filtering between visuals.

Step 7: Insights and Analysis
•	Identify states with the highest and lowest literacy rates.
•	Highlight gender disparities in workforce participation.
•	Show trends in population growth across states.

Step 8: Testing and Validation
•	Validate all calculations and relationships.
•	Test the responsiveness and accuracy of slicers and filters.

Step 9: Dashboard Deployment
•	Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service.
•	Share access with relevant stakeholders.

Step 10: Documentation and Training
•	Document the dashboard structure, purpose, and functionalities.
•	Provide training sessions for users and stakeholders.
